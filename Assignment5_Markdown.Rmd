Part One: Compare trends in total graduate enrollment for males and females (including full-time/part-time and private/public universities) in the United States from 1967 - 2015.
```{r, part 1}
#performing linear regression to find trends in the data between M/F enrollment throughout time

female_lm <- lm(grad$Total_Females ~ grad$Year)
male_lm   <- lm(grad$Total_Males ~ grad$Year)


summary(female_lm) 
summary(male_lm) 
  #The R^2 value tells us how much variance in our dependent variable is expained by our independent      variable
  #We use Multiple R-squared value for single linear regressions, and adjusted for multiple.


#Check for regression assumptions
plot(female_lm)
  #Uhm... what do we do when our model breaks assumptions of homoskedasticity?
      #Residuals vs Fitted shows our residuals violate the assumption of homoskedasticity. What does that mean for our R2 value? 

plot(male_lm)
  #Our data still violates homoskedasticity, but now are they also not normally distributed?? (QQ Plot)
