Part One: Compare trends in total graduate enrollment for males and females (including full-time/part-time and private/public universities) in the United States from 1967 - 2015.
```{r, part 1}
#performing linear regression to find trends in the data between M/F enrollment throughout time

female_lm <- lm(Total_Females ~ Year, data = grad)
male_lm   <- lm(Total_Males ~ Year, data = grad)

#Use stargazer to create regression table
#stargazer(female_lm, male_lm, type = "html")

stargazer(female_lm, male_lm, type = 'html', out="test.htm")
    #Comparing trends in male and female graduate enrollment by means of a linear model, 1967-2015

## is this table working for you?

summary(female_lm) 
summary(male_lm) 
  #The R^2 value tells us how much variance in our dependent variable is expained by our independent      variable
  #We use Multiple R-squared value for single linear regressions, and adjusted for multiple.


#Check for regression assumptions
plot(female_lm)
  #Uhm... what do we do when our model breaks assumptions of homoskedasticity?
      #Residuals vs Fitted shows our residuals violate the assumption of homoskedasticity. What does that mean for our R2 value? 

plot(male_lm)
  #Our data still violates homoskedasticity, but now are they also not normally distributed?? (QQ Plot)


#Use the cor.test() function to find Pearsonâ€™s r for the linear relationship described between year and graduate enrollment.
    #cor.test(x,y)
female_pr <- cor.test(grad$Year, grad$Total_Females)
female_pr

male_pr <- cor.test(grad$Year, grad$Total_Males)
male_pr


#Simplified -- Female
#The model (female graduate enrollment = 30,126*(year) - 58955502; no. of students) explains a significant amount of variance in female graduate enrollment (F(1,47) = 2669, p < 0.01, R2 = 0.98, Pearson's r = 0.99)

#Thorough -- Female
#Total female graduate enrollment is significantly predicted by year (b = -58955502, t(47) = 2669) with a strong positive correlation (Pearson's R = 0.99). The overall model (female enrollment = 30,126*year - 58955502, count of students) explains a significant amount of variance in total female graduate enrollment (F(1,47) = 2669, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.98).

#Simplified -- Male
#The model (male graduate enrollment = 9,069*(year) - 17112153; no. of students) explains a significant amount of variance in total male graduate enrollment (F(1,47) = 276, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.85, Pearson's r = 0.92)

##Thorough -- Male
##Total male graduate enrollment is significantly predicted by year (b = - 17112153, t(47) = Daphne where are you finding the female t-val? ) with a strong positive correlation (Pearson's R = 0.86). The model (male graduate enrollment = 9,069*(year) - 17112153; no. of students) explains a significant amount of variance in total male graduate enrollment (F(1,47) = 276, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.85, Pearson's r = 0.92)

Part 3. Compare median salaries for male and female doctorate recipients in 2015. Answer these two questions: 

(1) Does median salary differ significantly between male and female starting postdoc positions? 

(2) Does median salary differ significantly between male and female PhD recipients in non-postdoc employment positions?
```{r}
#Look at lecture 11. To compare medians, we use Mann-Whitney U. HOWEVER. Because the data is paired, we use Wilcoxon Signed-Rank (Lab 7)
#Male and female salaries for starting postdoctoral and other employment positions (2015)

#load in the data
phd_salary <- read_csv("PhD_Salary.csv")

postdoc <- wilcox.test(phd_salary$Male_Postdoc, phd_salary$Female_Postdoc, paired = TRUE)
non_postdoc <- wilcox.test(phd_salary$Male_Employment, phd_salary$Female_Employment, paired = TRUE)

#H0: Ranks are equal
#HA: Ranks are NOT equal
  #Samples are not independent
  #Data is paired because we are comparing 


postdoc

##data:  phd_salary$Male_Postdoc and phd_salary$Female_Postdoc
##V = 19.5, p-value = 0.8884

##Retain the null

non_postdoc

##data:  phd_salary$Male_Employment and phd_salary$Female_Employment
##V = 101, p-value = 0.002572

##Accept the alternative

vif(fac_lm2)
  #Can get rid of years_service and post grad years since they're collinear. Explain that they are better off explained in rank (Prof, Ass. Prof, Asst. Prof)
